To declare a variable you need to know it's data type as well.
When you declare a variable, say, int x = 10; a location in computer's RAM is named x and 10 is stored in it.
/ gives quotient and % gives remainder.
There is no BODMAS. *, %, / have equal priority and higher than + and - which are equal to each other.
Among operators with equal prirority, generally the one on the left is executed first.
use parenthesis to over-ride order of execution of operators.
The first part of statement is known as Initialization. (int i = 1), the second part is known as Evaluation . (i <= 10), the last part is known as increment. (i++)
To do exponentiation use Math.pow function.

The processor has the computational power to compute about (10)^9 operations within 1 second,Which is due to the fact that it runs 3*(10)^9 clock cycles/sec .
